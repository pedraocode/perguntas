    <h3>What do you mean by "Figma assets"?</h3>
    <p>You will have access to download the full Figma project <br> including all of the pages, the components, responsive<br> pages, and also the icons, illustrations, and images <br>included in the screens.</p>
<h3>What does "lifetime access" exactly mean?</h3>

<p>Once you have purchased either the design, code, or<br> both packages, you will have access to all of the future<br> updates based on the roadmap, free of charge.</p>
<h3>How does support work?</h3>
<p>We are aware of the importance of well qualified<br> support, that is why we decided that support will only be<br> provided by the authors that actually worked on this<br> project.</p>
<p>You can <a href="#">contact us</a>on this page via email or discuss via <br>the chatroom on the bottom right side of this page. </p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="#"> join our Discord channel</a> and let one of the<br> project maintainers know that you have purchased<br> Flowbite Pro. You will then have access to a private <br>support channel.</p>
<h3>I want to build more than one project with Flowbite Pro.<br> Is that allowed?</h3>
<p>You can use Flowbite for an unlimited amount of projects,<br> whether it is a personal website, a SaaS app, or a website<br> for a client. As long as you don't build a product that will<br> directly compete with Flowbite either as a UI kit, theme,<br> or template, it is fine.</p>
<p>Find out more information by <a href="#">reading the license</a>.</p>
<h3>What does "free updates" include?</h3>
<p>The free updates that will be provided is based on the<br><a href="#">roadmap</a>  that we have laid out for this project. It is also<br> possible that we will provide extra updates outside of the<br> roadmap as well.</p>
<h3>What does the free version include?</h3>
<p>The <a href="#">free version</a> of Flowbite includes a minimal style<br> guidelines, component variants, and a dashboard page<br> with the mobile version alongside it.</p>
<p>You can use this version for any purposes, because it is<br> open-source under the MIT license.</p>
<h3>Is there React/Vue/Svelte version supported?</h3>
<p>Currently the most supported framework is React and<br> Next.js next to the Figma and HTML + JavaScript version <br>of Flowbite Pro. We already offer a dashboard in React<br> and Next.js and over 300 blocks and components in<br> React.</p>
<p>Eventually all of the pro components, sections, and pages<br> will be integrated into React, Vue, and Svelte. This will<br> take some time and you should expect the React version<br> to be released the soonest.</p>
<p>These launches also depend on how fast we can build<br> the libraries such as Flowbite React, Flowbite Vue,<br> Flowbite Svelte, and Flowbite Angular.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between Tailwind UI and Flowbite<br> Pro?</h3>
<p>The main difference is that you get everything you see in<br> the demo already put together, in comparison with<br> Tailwind UI where you have to manually put together the<br> section based code blocks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Flowbite also offers a set of advanced <br>libraries such as charts, calendar, kanban board which<br> Tailwind UI does not currently support.</p>
<p>Lastly, as Tailwind UI announced that it will no longer<br> support Figma for future release, with Flowbite you can<br> rest assured that we will keep updating the Figma files as<br> we develop new pages and sections.</p>
<h3>When can we expect the launch of E-commerce UI?</h3>
<p>We have launched the first batch of E-commerce UI in <br>Figma which includes over 50 new UI components, 40 <br>block sections and 8 pages.</p>
<p>The coded version will be launched in a phased way in<br> the following months and we will release new pages,<br> components, and sections in the future.</p>
<h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
<p>If you are unhappy with your purchase, just <a href="#"> contact us</a><br>within 30 days and we'll issue a full refund.</p>
<h3>Is it allowed to use the design assets, such as the fonts,<br> icons, and illustrations?</h3>
<p>What you see is what you get. Which means that all <br>icons, fonts, and illustrations can be used based on the<br> licensing that we researched or purchased. For example, <br>we purchased rights to use the illustrations in Flowbite.</p>
<h3>Where can I access my download files?</h3>
<p>After you purchased one of the plans, you will get two<br> emails: one for the invoice, and another one with the<br> download files.</p>
<p>Soon we will create a way that you will be able to access <br>the download files from the Flowbite dashboard from<br> this website.</p>
<h3>I have a company registered for VAT. Where can I add<br> the VAT for the invoice?</h3>
<p>After initializing the checkout process from Paddle, you<br> will be able to see a text "Add VAT code". Click on that,<br> and add the VAT code for your company. This will also<br> remove the extra VAT tax from the purchase.</p>
<h3>Do you offer discounts for students or non-profit <br>organizations?</h3>
<p>We do have a special discount for students and non-<br>profit organizations. Otherwise, we never offer discounts<br> not even for Black Friday because want to protect the<br> purchase value for all of our customers.</p>
<p>To apply for the student or non-profit discount, please<br> send an email from your student or non-profit <br>organization email address using our <a href="#">contact form</a>.</p>
